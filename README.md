# hello-world
Just Trying to learn GitHub
I am new to GitHub and I am here to make some changes in the master file. 
I am making few changes to see the effect of commit.
#Here I am just trying to test how to squash different commits into ONE commit

                 Hello
    'package('package_name').define "OPTION", "VALUE"'
    
Because of cmake's aggressive caching behaviour, manual options
given to cmake will be overriden by autoproj later on. To make
such options permanent, add

    package('package_name').define "OPTION", "VALUE"

in overrides.rb. For instance, to set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for the rtt
package, do

    package('rtt').define "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE", "Debug"
    
And similarly we are testing this

    Hi 
    
    
Again we here

    So
    Alles Gut
